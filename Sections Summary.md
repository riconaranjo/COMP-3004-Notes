# Sections Summary

Summaries of each section covered in this course.

# Section 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Software engineering is about creating a solution to a problem.

## Software Development Phase

- **Requirements analysis**
  - requirements elicitation
  - analysis
  - _results in requirement analysis document_
- **Design**
  - high-level system design
  - detailed object design
  - _results in system design document_
- **Implementation**
- **Testing**
  - unit testing + integration testing
  - system testing
- **Deployment and maintenance**

## Software Development Products

**Work Product:** unit of work (e.g. diagrams / source code / etc)
- **functional model:** _system behaviour_ from user's point of view
- **dynamic model:** _internal system behaviour_ from user's point of view
- **object model:** system objects / attributes / operations

**Deliverable:** work product delivered to client

## Unified Modelling Language

**UML** is **a tool** for expressing **system models**:
- **functional models**
  - use-case diagrams
- **dynamic models**
  - state-machine diagrams
  - sequence diagrams
  - activity diagrams
- **object models**
  - class diagrams

# Section 2: Requirements Analysis

The **goals** of the requirement analysis phase is:
1. to understand the problem
2. model the application domain

## Results of Requirements Analysis
- **functional requirements**
  - functional model
- **non-functional requirements**
  - the dynamic model
- **analysis object model**

## Functional Model

System behaviour from user's point of view.
- use-case diagrams [scenarios]

## Dynamic Model

Internal system behaviour from user's point of view.
- state-machine diagrams [states]
- sequence diagrams [order of events]
- activity diagrams [concurrency]

## Object Model

Objects + their attributes + their operations.
- class diagrams [object associations]

# Section 3: High-Level System Design

The goal of high-level system design is to turn the analysis products into a system design model.
- figure out what the subsystems are [inital subsystem decomposition]
  - then what is the best suited architecture [refined subsystem decomposition]

## Results of High-Level System Design

**System design model:**
- subsystem decomposition
- system architecture strategies

## Initial Subsystem Decomposition

This phase is about determining:
- **design goals** [based on functional / non-functional requirements]
- **initial subsystem decomposition**

## Refined Subsystem Decomposition

This phase is about determining
- refined subsystem decomposition
- system architecture strategies

# Section 5: Implementation

# Section 6: Testing

# Section 7: Software Management

# Section 8: Professional Ethics
